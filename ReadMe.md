# SQL Prompt Collection

## What
This repository contains a curated set of **prompt templates** for large language models (LLMs) to:
- Generate SQL queries from natural language questions.
- Evaluate and fix invalid or inaccurate SQL.
- Adapt SQL for different database dialects.
- Validate correctness before execution.

The prompts include variations for:
- Simple NL-to-SQL conversion.
- Schema-aware query generation.
- Dialect-specific syntax handling.
- Structured JSON or code-block outputs for downstream automation.

## Why
These prompts were designed to:
- **Standardize** how SQL is generated and fixed across projects.
- **Reduce errors** by enforcing schema constraints and validation rules.
- **Improve accuracy** with dialect-aware syntax and context-aware reasoning.
- **Enable automation** through strict output formatting that machines can reliably parse.

By using these templates, teams can ensure consistent, accurate, and maintainable SQL query generation workflows.
